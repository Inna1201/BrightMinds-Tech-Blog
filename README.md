# BrightMinds-Tech-Blog

My name is Inna Mamedova, I am a student of Birmingham University Coding Bootcamp.
In this challenge I have built a CMS-style application that allow developers publish their blog posts and comment other developers posts.


# Project requirements
Build from scratch a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site and deploy it to Heroku. Follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js, Sequelize and the express-session npm package for authentication.



# Details
I have installed all necessary dependencies.
I have created a file structure.
I have followed a MVC framework as a pattern of software design.
I have used Handlebars.js as the templating language.
I have styled the application using bootstrap and plain css.
I have created a models to store data and data-related logic.
I have created and seeded the database with sample data.
I have used connection.js file to create a connection to the database.
I have created routes to get, create, update and delete necessary data.
Both Frontend and Backend development made an application look and function in the most efficient manner.
Also the application has been deployed to Heroku.
